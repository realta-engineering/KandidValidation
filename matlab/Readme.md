Purpose of this validation, is to validate the SDNN(5min window) and RMSSD(5min window) calculations done on the Kandid App using Matlab. kandid_data.csv is directly exported from the Kandid app, and kandid_data.mat is the matlab equivalent of the data once it was imported into Matlab. Run testkandiddatasdnnandrmssdvalidation on Matlab to see results. Summary of results below

SDNN Average Absolute Error

ans =

   3.6797e-15

RMSSD Average Absolute Error

ans =

   6.3400e-15
